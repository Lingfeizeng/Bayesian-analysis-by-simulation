# Bayesian analysis by simulation

### The difference between Frequentist and Baysian:

Y ~ N(μ,σ2)

**Frequentist**: μ and σ2 are fixed
**Bayesian**: μ and σ2 are random variables

**Bayesian inference**: using Bayes Theroem to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution or statistical model

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
**Classical Bayesian inference**: the conjugated prior should be chosen so that the resulting posterior density can be recognised as the density of a known distribution. 

**MCMC**: to approximate the posterior distribution of a parameter of interest by random sampling in a probabilistic space.
