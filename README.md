# Bayesian analysis by simulation

### The difference between Frequentist and Baysian:

Y ~ N(μ,σ2)

**Frequentist**: μ and σ2 are fixed
**Bayesian**: μ and σ2 are random variables

**Bayesian inference**: using Bayes Theroem to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution or statistical model
